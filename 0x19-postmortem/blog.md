Postmortem: Outage of Web Application Due to Jinja Template Rendering Issue
Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:

Start Time: June 5, 2024, 10:00 AM UTC
End Time: June 5, 2024, 12:30 PM UTC
Impact:

The main web application was down, rendering HTTP 500 errors.
80% of users were unable to access the main page or experienced significant delays.
Root Cause:

A bug in the Jinja template rendering process caused by a missing context variable.
Timeline
10:00 AM - Issue detected via automated monitoring alert indicating HTTP 500 errors.
10:05 AM - Initial investigation began; logs were reviewed to identify the source of errors.
10:15 AM - The assumption was made that the issue was related to a recent deployment; the deployment was rolled back.
10:30 AM - Rollback did not resolve the issue; further investigation focused on server performance.
11:00 AM - Misleading path: Assumed issue was related to server memory; restarted the server and checked resource usage.
11:15 AM - Customer complaints escalated the issue to the engineering team.
11:30 AM - Detailed review of application logs identified a missing context variable in a Jinja template.
12:00 PM - Patch created and tested locally to fix the missing variable issue.
12:15 PM - Patched application deployed to production.
12:30 PM - Monitoring confirmed resolution; all services restored and running normally.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a missing context variable in the Jinja template used for rendering the main page of the web application. This variable was essential for the template to render correctly, and its absence led to a template rendering error, which caused the application to throw HTTP 500 errors.

Resolution:
The issue was resolved by identifying the missing context variable through detailed log analysis. A patch was created to ensure that the variable was properly passed to the Jinja template. This patch was tested locally to confirm the fix before being deployed to the production environment.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:

Improve the logging mechanism to provide more detailed error messages, particularly for template rendering issues.
Enhance the monitoring system to detect and alert for specific template rendering errors.
Review and update the deployment process to include checks for necessary context variables.
TODO List:

Patch Nginx Server:
Ensure the server configuration is optimized for better performance and error handling.
Add Monitoring on Server Memory:
Implement detailed monitoring to track memory usage and detect anomalies.
Improve Log Details:
Enhance log details to include specific information about missing variables in templates.
Update Deployment Scripts:
Add checks in deployment scripts to verify that all required context variables are present.
Conduct Training:
Train the engineering team on common template rendering issues and debugging techniques.
Regular Code Reviews:
Implement regular code reviews focusing on template and context variable handling.
By addressing these issues and implementing the above measures, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future and improve the overall reliability of our web application.
