Task 0: Simple Web Stack Infrastructure Design
Scenario: A user wants to access the website hosted at www.foobar.com.

Infrastructure Components:

Server: A physical or virtual machine that hosts all components of the web infrastructure.
Web Server (Nginx): Responsible for handling HTTP requests from clients and serving static content. It can also act as a reverse proxy for the application server.
Application Server: Executes server-side code, processes dynamic content requests, and interacts with the database.
Application Files (Code Base): Contains the website's code and files required for its functionality.
Database (MySQL): Stores and manages website data.
Domain Name: foobar.com

A domain name is a human-readable address used to access websites on the Internet.
The domain name foobar.com is configured with a www record that points to the server's IP address (8.8.8.8).
Specifics about the Infrastructure:

Server: The physical or virtual machine where all components of the web infrastructure are installed and run.
Domain Name: Acts as a pointer to the server's IP address, allowing users to access the website using a memorable name.
DNS Record: The www record in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, which is an alias for foobar.com.
Web Server (Nginx): Receives HTTP requests from clients, serves static content, and forwards dynamic content requests to the application server.
Application Server: Executes server-side code (e.g., PHP, Python, Ruby), processes requests, and generates dynamic content for the web server to serve.
Database: Stores website data, such as user information, posts, or product details.
Communication: The server communicates with the user's computer over the Internet using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.
Issues with the Infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
Since all components are hosted on a single server, any failure in the server hardware or software could lead to downtime for the entire website.
Downtime during Maintenance:
Performing maintenance tasks, such as deploying new code or updates, may require restarting the web server, resulting in temporary downtime for users accessing the website.
Limited Scalability:
The infrastructure may struggle to handle high traffic volumes as it's confined to a single server. Scaling up to accommodate increased traffic would require significant hardware upgrades or migration to a more scalable architecture.

Task 0: Distributed Web Infrastructure
Design Overview:
For this three-server web infrastructure, the aim is to create a scalable, fault-tolerant setup to handle web traffic efficiently. It consists of two web servers - one serving as an Nginx web server, the other as an application server. Additionally, there is an HAproxy load balancer to distribute incoming traffic, and a MySQL database for data storage.

Components:
Nginx Web Server: Nginx is chosen for its high performance and efficient resource utilization. It will serve static content and act as a reverse proxy to the application server.

Application Server: This server will handle dynamic content generation, executing server-side scripts, and processing user requests. It's separated from the Nginx server to distribute the workload effectively.

HAproxy Load Balancer: HAproxy is used for load balancing to evenly distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers. It improves performance, scalability, and provides high availability by directing requests only to healthy servers.

MySQL Database: MySQL is selected as the database management system for its reliability, performance, and robust feature set. It will store and manage website data securely.

Load Balancer Distribution Algorithm:
The load balancer will use a round-robin algorithm to distribute incoming requests evenly across the Nginx and application servers. This ensures that no single server becomes overloaded while others remain underutilized, optimizing resource usage and maintaining high availability.

MySQL Master-Replica Cluster:
To enhance database reliability and scalability, a MySQL Master-Replica cluster will be set up. The master node will handle write operations while replica nodes replicate data from the master and handle read operations. This setup improves fault tolerance and read scalability.

Single Points of Failure and Security Issues:
Single Points of Failure:
The single HAproxy load balancer and MySQL Master node are potential single points of failure. Implementing redundancy or failover mechanisms is essential to mitigate this risk.
Security Issues:
Data transmitted between servers should be encrypted to prevent eavesdropping. Implementing SSL/TLS certificates ensures secure communication.
Access control measures should be implemented to restrict unauthorized access to servers and databases.


Task 2: Secured and Monitored Web Infrastructure
Design Overview:
Building upon the previous infrastructure, this enhanced setup focuses on security and monitoring aspects to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and system availability.

Additional Components:
Firewalls: Three firewalls are added to control and monitor incoming and outgoing traffic. They provide an additional layer of security by filtering network traffic based on predefined security rules.

SSL Certificate for HTTPS: SSL certificates are implemented to enable HTTPS, encrypting data transmitted between clients and servers. This ensures data confidentiality and protects against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Monitoring Clients: Three monitoring clients are deployed to continuously monitor server health, performance metrics, and network activity. They provide real-time insights into system status, facilitating proactive issue detection and resolution.

Identified Problems:
SSL Termination: While SSL termination at the load balancer improves performance by offloading SSL decryption, it creates a single point of failure for SSL processing. Implementing SSL termination at the application servers can mitigate this risk.

Single MySQL Server: Having a single MySQL server poses a single point of failure for the database. Implementing a MySQL Master-Replica cluster or MySQL Master-Master replication can enhance database availability and fault tolerance.

Uniformity in Server Components: The uniformity in server components across the infrastructure may lead to homogeneity risks, where vulnerabilities affecting one component may propagate to others. Implementing diversity in server components can mitigate this risk.


Task 3: Scale Up (Optional)
Design Overview:
In this optional task, the infrastructure is scaled up by adding one additional server and configuring the HAproxy load balancer as a cluster. Each component (web server, application server, database) will be hosted on individual servers to distribute the workload effectively and enhance fault tolerance.

Justification for Each Element:
Additional Server: Adding another server increases capacity and fault tolerance by distributing the workload across more resources.

HAproxy Load Balancer Cluster: Configuring HAproxy as a cluster enhances scalability and availability by allowing multiple load balancers to share the traffic load. It provides redundancy and ensures uninterrupted service even if one load balancer fails.

Separate Server Components: Hosting each component on individual servers improves resource isolation, scalability, and fault tolerance. It allows for independent scaling of resources based on demand and minimizes the impact of failures on other components.

This setup ensures high availability, scalability, and security while providing the foundation for future expansion and optimization of the web infrastructure.
